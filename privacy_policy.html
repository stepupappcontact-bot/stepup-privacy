Privacy Policy  
Last updated: November 2025

StepUp (“the App”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) is a personal development and habit-tracking application designed to help users improve their daily routines, track habits, and journal their thoughts.

We value your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how it is used, and your rights regarding your data.

## 1. Information We Collect  
StepUp does **NOT** collect, store, transmit, or share any personal information to external servers.

All data — including tasks, habits, journals, XP, streaks, badges, and settings — is stored **locally on your device** using secure system storage.

We do **not** collect or process the following:
- Name or contact information  
- Email address  
- Device identifiers  
- Location data  
- Usage analytics  
- Health data  
- Financial data  
- Advertising data  
- Browsing activity  
- Third-party data  

The App does not communicate with any external databases or online servers.

The only optional data accessed by the App is:
- **Photos (local only)** — if you select a profile image or add a journal image.  
  These photos are never uploaded or shared.

## 2. How Your Data Is Stored  
All user data is stored **only on your device**, inside:
- Secure local storage (SharedPreferences)  
- Local app files (journal entries, habits)

No data leaves the device.

If you delete the App or reset your device, the data will be permanently removed unless your device performs a system-level backup (such as iCloud or Android device backup).

- Creating & managing tasks  
- Tracking habits  
- Calculating XP, level, and streak progress  
- Displaying insights & statistics  
- Saving journal entries  
- Saving your app settings (sound, preferences)

No data is transmitted to us or any third party.

## 4. Third-Party Services  
StepUp does **NOT** use:
- Analytics SDKs  
- Advertising SDKs  
- Third-party tracking tools

No data is shared with any external organization.

## 5. Children’s Privacy  
StepUp is not intended for children under 13.  
We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.

---

## 6. Your Rights  
Since all data is stored only on your device, you have full control over it.

You can:
- Delete all tasks, habits, or journals from the Settings page  
- Delete the App  
- Reset XP, streak, or badges  

We do not store any copies of your information.
